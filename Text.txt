I am a big failure.
I will fail in class 11 class final test examination.
I am not able to perform as I want.
I am not also able to keep my parents image on society.
I can not overcome from my bad habbits and addiction.
I know that I should change my life.
I need a support to overcome all of hurdels of life and be a successful man in life but I can not do that .
Will I commit sucide ?
Becuase really I am fruustated with whole socity, Indian education system and a trend of memorise all informations.
I know that I can not memorise every thing. 
I am unable to memorise all this things.
My memory power is very little.
No, I have to study.
I have to overcome all of my bad habbits and addictions.
I have to be a good idol boy.
I should tell all mater to my parents.
Will is worthy?
Can they help me?
I lose my one year, 365 days, by sleeping, and enjoying.
I can not utilize the time.
I can get back the time.
Next year I should study from day 1.
I should not destroy more time of my life.
And also I should not depand on anyone.
I should not beg for help from anyone.
I have to be self dependent.
I should not disturb other for my self satisfaction and self motivation.
I should be my self one and only.
And my family members are always there for my help.
They are alwaays for my help and blessing.
They love me and ther want to see myself as a successful person.
So I should do so.
I decided to do only such things that effect my life and my future goals form good side.
I have to study more.
More more than far of my limits.
In class 12 I have to push my limits.
